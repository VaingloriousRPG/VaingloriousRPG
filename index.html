    <div class="main">
        <div class="intro"><p>Welcome to Vainglorious.</p>
            <p>Vainglorious is an old-school role-playing game with an emphasis on player interaction.  
                <br>Players volunteer to join a group with the goal of bringing a unique adventure to life.
                <br>A Gamemaster organizes and creates the world through which players experience adventures with their characters and imagination.</p>  
            <p>This system is designed to support a wide range of play styles, providing a framework of rules and methods for creating and 
            interacting with a vibrant mythical world.
                <br>Magic spells, combat, movement, concoctions, planar travel, and the passage of time are all 
                defined and designed for ease of use and logical connection.</p>
            <p>A wide variety of character classes allow players to experience adventures from a distinct 
                perspective with widely varying spells, skills, and abilities.  
                <br>Combining unique strengths and weaknesses, each class allows players to solve problems and complete quests through wit and guile.</p>
            <p>The passage of time plays a significant role in all aspects of the game.  Concoctions go bad, spells wane, and the world moves along.  
               <br>Tracking time both during and between adventures adds a sense of realism to what otherwise might seem like a static world.
            <br>Gamemasters are encouraged to integrate the passage of time into adventures.</p>
            <p>Movement on the world map has been simplified to a mark system.  
                <br>Marks are a loosely defined distance that a humanoid can normally walk in one day.  
                <br>That distance varies by terrain and roads, allowing for a more organic feel than grid systems.</p>
            <p>We hope that you will find these rules as useful, exciting, and entertaining as we do.</p>
