            These melee specialists bear the brunt of enemy attacks.
            Racial traits and ability adjustments can determine a fighters style. 
            Wielding a fearsome duo-handed sword or bracing against an
            onslaught in field-plate and shield, racial choice will enhance or 
            compliment your fighting style.

            Fighters create a barrier between the enemy and the fighter's less armored companions.
            Unlike soldiers in a military formation, adventurer fighters must excel at controlling 
            their immediate vicinity.  Though others may protect the flanks, a few fighters can 
            hold the line.
