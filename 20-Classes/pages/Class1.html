            Whether you play Tier Zero out or not, the basic spells gained here stay with 
            an adventurer, no matter which class they choose. However, since the point 
            cost is a percentage of your total, these simple spells become very expensive
             to throw as you advance levels. The semi-out-of-control magic used when
              casting these spells creates an aura that is bright and very noticeable to 
              anyone observing.
