        <p>Dokour play with fire, both magical and metaphorical.
            Dokour magic centers around spells of fire, dead (& undead), 
            and the mysterious Dimension plane.
            Most all of their spells burn, even the begnin ones. 
            Travelling to Dimension through a Dokour portal will singe a hardened adventurer, 
            lesser souls will not survive the passing.</p>
            <p>All this pain and power do not come without a cost.
                Dokour are most uniformly evil.  
                They will hunt down their own kind who tread even the neutral path (dare not mention "good").</p>
                <p>A caution against thinking they are of no use.  
                A strong Dokour who swears to a goal can be worth their weight in gold.  
                Cantankerous compatriots with a reasoning all their own.
