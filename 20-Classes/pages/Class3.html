        <p>Rogues are masters of Urban environments, stealth, and misdirection.
            Though considered to be worthless scoundrels by many, few are willing
            to challenge them on their own turf.
        </p>
        <p>
            Rogues run the gamut from Robin Hood to outright thieves.  
        Their skills at lockpicking, traps, disguise, and Flank attacks make them valuable companions 
        and essential to any adventuring group. (Those same skills may warrant some consternation for personal belongings.)  
        Though you may not be privy to all their methods, Rogues almost always prove their value in the long run.
