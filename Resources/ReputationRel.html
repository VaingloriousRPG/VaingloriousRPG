    <div class="title">Reputation and Religiosity</div>

            <p>Note the issue of Religion is alive and well in this game.<br>

    However, casters and religion are separate issues.  Your character can follow any religion 
        and be of any class.  </p>

    <p>By following one of the religions your character has the opportunity to work up in the church.
    While you most likely won't run the church, you could become an important figure for/with it.
    Sound like a Paladin (religious fighter) or a Cleric (religious caster)?</p>

    <p>By following a political group you can employ the same methods used by churches.  Get to know them.  
    Create a relationship.  Work towards the goals of theirs that you agree with.
    This is one of the ways to become a Knight (fighter type?) or a Royal Counselor (any class?)</p>

    
<p class="moodTitle">ALIGNMENT</p>

    <p>How does it work?</p>
       <p>Aligment runs from -200 up to +200.   The lower the number is the more you are leaning 
        towards the evil side of life.   Conversely, the higher the number is the more you are leaning 
        towards the good side of life.  Sometimes the progression of a character or the choices made by 
        a character will jump over one group or another.  But the ultimate goal is to represent the alignment 
        number that is quickly interpreted.</p>

    <p>What does it impact?</p>
    <p>The alignment number is there for the GM’s effort to consistently portray the NPC.  
        Thus, an NPC fighter with a -81 alignment that the GM has not run before (or in a long time) 
        can remind the GM how to play that NPC.</p>
    
    <p>Alignment is all about the NPC interactions.  It is one of the tools a GM that can be used to determine 
        an NPC’s initial reaction or choices.   This has no binding effect on how a player runs their character.  
        The player can slowly creep their rating into the deep negatives and still choose to be extremely kind.   
        Furthermore, any initial meet up between a player character and an NPC will very likely be based on the 
        current local situation more than these numbers.   </p>
    
    <p>The players experience points do indicate how the GM is veiwing the players character.  
        If the player is gone and the character needs to be run by the GM this alignment mayhelp.  
        If the player sees an aligment move too far up or down they are free to make current efforts to change that.
          But remember the player characters alignment is NOT likely to be a GM’s major indicator of how to play.</p>
