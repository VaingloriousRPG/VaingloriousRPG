            GAMING STYLE
Every gaming group has it's own style.  Our game is based around a bunch of people gaming as an excuse to get together.  We are less interested in power leveling or an exact portrayal of our characters.  We're more oriented around the fun of the game.   This doesn't mean the players aren't interested in getting levels and items.  Just that it isn't the focus of the game.  So, plainly stated, in my game I value player fun over characters played 'properly'.  If you are looking for a game that is all about role playing a character like an actor on stage then you've got the wrong game here.

Any GM can roll dice and ignore the results, just to make up what he wants the group to do.  Or a GM can give the players items only to justify how the rewards are taken away, wear down, or loose effect.   There are many ways a GM can 'work' the group.   

My game is based on trust with the players.  This is a trust that I work to earn.  My role is to ensure the system is balanced and to arbitrate the rules.  This judgement of the rules should not result in judging the players, just the rulings.  When I start playing control games with the players I start losing respect and trust.   I choose to run a system that you can conquer if you out manuever your opponents.  If I plan out an encounter and the group is simply too much for my plans then I lose.  Simple as that.  If you do the unexpected then my world must flex or react to it.  But as a GM I should not work against the players.  I should ensure my world is reacting and acting as appropriate to the situation.   

The reason I take this point of view is from a selfish perspective.  There are times I need to say to the group 'I know this doesn't seem right... trust me'.  When I need to I will cash in some of the trust I've earned.   I'll still be working within the rules but there are often times when the players can't see the whole story.  This is when players are apt to think they are being controlled.  If I've earned the benefit of the doubt then all runs smooth.  If not, then I (and any GM) would have a more difficult time.   So, you see, I earn the trust for a selfish reason.  To make the game easier for me.   Nice that it makes it easier for the players too!

Another part of my style is my belief that this is a game.  This is not real.  This should not be the most important thing in someones life.  I spend a lot of time with game design.  But I make my living more mundanely and that is my 2nd highest priority.  My first is my family.   Therefore, I expect that the players in my game have a healthy balance for themselves.
