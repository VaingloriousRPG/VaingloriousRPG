            Lowlander- Found in practically all places, the lowlanders are the most frequently seen and 
            abundant of all the human races. Their familiarity and accustomedness with a cosmopolitan 
            lifestyle and thus frequent dealings have allowed them to build up a reliable reputation 
            with tradesmen of the realm. By acquiring knowledge about the ins and outs of barter, 
            regardless of where they may find themselves, a slight discount on purchases within reason 
            can be had.<br>
            It goes without saying that, being highly curious by nature, it is not at all uncommon for 
            them to migrate. In a world so large, there is much to learn and discover.
