    <div class="title">High Elf</div>
    <div>
        <p> Not all that uncommonly priggish, the high elves sit most comfortably wherever there is an 
            abundance of others, making it extremely unlikely to come across a lowly one in areas of lower 
            populace or even independently. Their high social needs and fixation on status must be satisfied, 
            as any less surely wouldnâ€™t do. <br>
            Having knowledge of etiquette and an air of eloquence, diplomacy, or settling civil matters 
            come just as naturally to them as breathing. Therefore, they are well suited for situations in 
            which making a mutually beneficial good first impression is essential. 
        </p>
